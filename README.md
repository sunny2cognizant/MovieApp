Movie App
Description
The Movie App is a React-based web application that fetches movie details using an external API. The application provides users with an intuitive interface to browse movies, view detailed information, and interact with various features. State management across components is handled efficiently using React Context.
Features
• Browse Movies: Fetch and display a list of movies using an API.
• Movie Details: View detailed information about a selected movie (e.g., title, description, release date, rating, etc.).
• Responsive Design: Optimized for desktop and mobile devices.
• Global State Management: React Context is used for state handling across components.
• Dynamic UI: React-based UI components ensure a smooth and interactive user experience.
Tech Stack
• Frontend: React (JSX, CSS, React Hooks)
• State Management: React Context
• API: Fetch movies from a third-party API (e.g., The Movie Database API)
• Styling: CSS for responsive and clean design

Usage
1. Open the app in your browser:
The app will be available at http://localhost:3000/ once the development server is running.
2. Browse Movies:
View a list of popular or trending movies fetched from the API.
3. View Movie Details:
Click on a movie to view detailed information.
React Context Overview
The application uses React Context to manage state globally across components:
• MovieContext: Provides the current movie list and selected movie details to all components.
• Actions Handled by Context:
• Fetching movies from the API.
• Storing selected movie details.
• Managing loading and error states.
API Integration
The app fetches data from an external movie API. Here is a sample API call:
const fetchMovies = async () => {
 const response = await fetch(`https://api.themoviedb.org/3/movies/popular?api_key=${process.env.REACT_APP_API_KEY}`);
 const data = await response.json();
 return data.results;
};
